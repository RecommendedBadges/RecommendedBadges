<!--
  @description       : Generic component to handle LWC errors. Displays exception type and message for end users, along with stack trace for administrators. 
                       Always shows errors through a modal for administrators and uses the same for end users if configured to do so (errors for end users are 
                       displayed as toasts by default). Creates a log using Nebula Logger (https://github.com/jongpie/NebulaLogger) in all cases.
                       Modal size, administrator profiles, and Nebula Logger save method can be customized.
